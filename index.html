            <h2>2.1 Explore Energy Usage</h2>
            <p>Analyzing energy consumption trends grouped by building reveals that the Charles Shipman Payson Building is the dominant contributor to energy usage. Regarding the Charles Shipman Payson Building, it's noteworthy that a downward trend has been evident since 2020.</p>
            <iframe src="https://observablehq.com/embed/c73984de6db59757?cells=overall" height="611"></iframe>
            <p>Since Charles Shipman Payson Building is the predominant building in usage, my next focus will be on understanding the types of energy contributing to the overall decrease in usage. The graph below illustrates that both the electric grid and fuel oil experienced a decline in 2021 and 2022 relative to 2020. Conversely, natural gas usage saw an increase in 2021 compared to 2020, but it also showed a decrease in 2022 when compared to 2020.</p>

        <!-- Section 2.2 -->
        <div class="section mb-4">
            <h2>2.2 Explore Overall Energy Usage Cost</h2>
            <p>My next inquiry is whether the overall costs have decreased in comparison to 2020, similar to the trend observed in energy consumption. The answer, however, is negative. Despite a reduction in overall energy usage since 2020, the total costs actually increased in both 2021 and 2022 compared to 2020.</p>
            <iframe src="https://observablehq.com/embed/c73984de6db59757?cells=overall3" height="611"></iframe>
            <p>My next question is: which type of energy usage is responsible for this rise in costs? Examining the electric type, we observe a decrease in 2021, followed by a significant increase in 2022 relative to 2020. In the case of natural gas, the costs increased in both 2021 and 2022 compared to 2020. This trend of rising costs over the past two years is also evident in the fuel oil type.</p>

            <h2>2.3 Why has energy usage declined while the overall energy costs have risen compared to 2020?</h2>
            <p>The answer lies in the unit cost - it's due to inflation?!</p>
