        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This page presents an analysis of energy consumption data with a focus on trends and patterns observed over a period of time. The data provides valuable insights into how energy usage has evolved in different categories and buildings. The analysis is divided into several key observations:

        <h2>Key Observations</h2>

                <p>
                    A clear seasonal effect is evident in the data. Seasonal variations in energy consumption are a common phenomenon and can provide insights into factors such as weather and climate that influence energy usage.

                    Analyzing the Total Usage grouped By Type reveals distinct patterns. Over the past 10 years, Electric Grid type shows relatively stable usage, whereas Fuel Oil and Portable Indoor types display a downward trend. Notably, Natural Gas usage is on the rise. This analysis highlights the changing landscape of energy sources and their popularity over time.

                    Examining Total Usage grouped by Building highlights interesting trends. Charles Shipman Payson Building has maintained relatively consistent usage over the past years. In contrast, Portland Museum of Art has seen an upward trend. The remaining three buildings have experienced a decline in usage. Understanding the energy consumption patterns of different buildings can be vital for making informed decisions on resource management and sustainability.
